    <h2>Advanced Geometry</h2>
    <p>This is a sample SCORM‑like package for the geometry course.  Real SCORM content would contain interactive lessons.</p>
    <p>Here you might learn about theorems, proofs and complex shapes.</p>
    <p>When finished, return to the LMS and mark the course completed.</p>
